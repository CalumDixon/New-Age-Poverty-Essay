  <meta name="description" content="The evidence is clear. UK Homeless populations are rapidly growing and technology's role in this is negative and positive. it has both contributed to the issue and been used to develop solutions. Ultimately technology is neither force for evil or good, it's a tool which can be used for either. What matters most is that we take action. What must be done is continuing to find new methods of using technology to help those in need, alongside finding ways to mitigate the harm caused to homeless communities from technology. For instance, one method can be seen in the form of government policy against the previously mentioned Airbnb. Many major cities across the globe have introduced rules to limit the number of days a host can sublet their property. London for example has restricted subletting to 90 days. Which has helped remove the incentive for landlords to move their properties to Airbnb as it has become less profitable." />

<h3>What potential does technology have for tackling homelessness?</h3>

<p class="para-after-title">It is undeniable that homeless populations in the UK are growing. As previously mentioned the charity Crisis UK has projected the homeless population will double in size to 575,000 people by 2041. The previous section demonstrated that this growth is in part caused by technology. However, technology can also have a positive impact. There are many examples of technology being harnessed to help those in poverty. To prove this, the section will be broken into two parts. Each will explore how technology can reduce homeless populations and aid the poor rather than punish them.</p>

<h4>How can technology help inform and connect homeless populations?</h4>

<p class="para-after-title">Similarly to how there is no singular cause for issues affecting those in poverty, there is also no single solution. However, technology opens the doors to methods that can form a larger solution. Take for example the lack of awareness surrounding where to seek help and what services are available to those in need. Technology offers the opportunity to better connect those in need with helpful services. An example of a digital tool tackling this issue is Ask Izzy. An Australian A-Z service directory for poverty support services developed by Infoxchange.</p>

<img src="images/image-8.png" alt="" class="body-image"/>

<p>Ask Izzy is a website that makes it quick and easy to connect those experiencing poverty with the support services that best fulfil their needs. Ask Izzy connects people with a wide range of support services such as housing, financial, health, addiction, food, education, legal, employment and more.<a href="references.html#40" class="refrence-link"><sup>[40]</sup></a> To do this Ask Izzy uses simple surveys to narrow the userâ€™s selection. Using questions such as asking for location data and if the individual has any limiting factors, for instance, a disability which might affect a provider's ability to offer care.<a href="references.html#41" class="refrence-link"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Using an individual with a disability as an example, without a system like Ask Izzy, they could waste time moving between support services which may not be equipped to provide for them. Ask Izzy avoids this by putting those in need with capable providers from the beginning. This helps to provide those in need access to support faster and easier, while also cutting wasted resources for service providers.</p>

<p>Since their debut in 2016, Ask Izzy has expanded significantly. Having grown to support over 370,000 services across the nation.<a href="references.html#42" class="refrence-link"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Today has facilitated over 4 million searches for support<a href="references.html#43" class="refrence-link"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and connects more than 10,000 people each month with the services they need most.<a href="references.html#44" class="refrence-link"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition, Ask Izzy also moved into providing a platform that can assess the supply and demand for services in the nation. Ask Izzy accomplishes this by utilizing the location data of service requests from their users alongside additional data sets provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Once all combined Ask Izzy can easily provide a full picture as to why users are seeking support and what their needs are. All of which makes it easier for services to focus their efforts where it matters most, as well as making it easier for policymakers to better assign funding.<a href="references.html#45" class="refrence-link"><sup>[45]</sup></a> For instance, one example of services using this data to benefit homeless communities is Orange Sky Laundry. Orange Sky is an Australian homeless charity that uses travelling vans to provide access to the homeless with access to shower and laundry facilities. Using Ask Izzy's data platform they are able to more efficiently decide where to send vans so that they can serve as many individuals as possible.<a href="references.html#46" class="refrence-link"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<img src="images/image-9.png" alt="" class="body-image"/>

<p>In the UK there is no system similar to Ask Izzy. Instead, GOV UK directs its users to their country's housing executive. If a user needs additional support GOV UK advises that users contact their local council.<a href="references.html#47" class="refrence-link"><sup>[47]</sup></a> While this may be effective for directing those in need of housing support it fails to address many of the other issues</p>

<p>For instance, It's well established that poverty and homelessness has a profound impact on one's mental and physical health. Evidence of this can be found in a study conducted by the Homeless Link. The study concluded that 73% of homeless people suffered from physical health issues. 41% of which were long term conditions. In comparison only 28% of the general public report having long term help conditions. The same study reported that 80% of UK homeless have suffered from mental health issues, of which 45% had been diagnosed with a mental illness.<a href="references.html#48" class="refrence-link"><sup>[48]</sup></a><a href="references.html#49" class="refrence-link"><sup>[49]</sup></a> These negative mental health effects are reflected in death statistics provided by the ONS (office of national statistics) which reported that suicide was the second leading cause of death in homeless populations.<a href="references.html#50" class="refrence-link"><sup>[50]</sup></a> Under Ask Izzy Australians can easily find services that offer support in areas such as mental and physical health. Whereas under systems like GOV UK the issue of shelter is the only one addressed. Leaving many to go without a comprehensive solution.</p>

<h4>How can technology be used to improve homeless service provider processes and access?</h4>

<p class="para-after-title">The value offered by tools that help inform and connect those in need with services such as Ask Izzy cannot be understated. However, the value they offer can only be actualised if those in need are being connected with services that are actually capable of helping. Technology offers the chance to break down barriers to support as well as improve services efficiency. All of which will allow services to help more people with the limited resources that they have. One such example includes MyPass, an initiative developed by the City of Austin, Texas.</p>

<img src="images/image-10.png" alt="" class="body-image"/>

<p>MyPass was Initially conceived in 2018, During the Austin City Blockchain Challenge Hackathon. The result was a blockchain-based platform, which plans to empower homeless individuals through the use of digital identities. Through MyPass those in need have the ability to securely store, validate and submit ID documents.<a href="references.html#51" class="refrence-link"><sup>[51]</sup></a> All of these make it easier to access vital services needed to end homeless as many services such as housing benefit and social care aren't accessible without valid documentation. MyPass accomplishes this through three steps. First, users upload a scan or photo of the ID document they would like to share, this document then goes on to be notarised so that it is valid for use. Secondly, the document is encrypted and hosted on the blockchain network so that it can be stored securely. Lastly, services can then request these documents from the user. If approved the file will be decrypted and ready for download on the service provider's end.<a href="references.html#52" class="refrence-link"><sup>[52]</sup></a><a href="references.html#53" class="refrence-link"><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p>Without MyPass individuals have to rely on their paper documentation. This approach becomes problematic when you consider how difficult it can be to maintain ID documents when homeless. This becomes especially true for those homeless individuals who have no safe space to store records.<a href="references.html#54" class="refrence-link"><sup>[54]</sup></a> MyPass has reported that 50% of homeless individuals seeking support from vital services lack a valid ID.<a href="references.html#55" class="refrence-link"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Replacing these lost ID documents can take up to 2-4 weeks.<a href="references.html#56" class="refrence-link"><sup>[56]</sup></a> This combined with the fact that many services require multiple forms of ID can greatly increase the time taken to access support. Using MyPass we can expedite these processes and provide support before it becomes too late.</p>

<p>The benefits of MyPass don't end at providing a more reliable form of identification for Austin's homeless population. MyPass can also enable service providers to act more efficiently in two ways. Firstly, with the use of MyPass there is no time wasted tracking down an individual's documentation. MyPass has reported that two local providers were spending $20,000 on document replacement assistance.<a href="references.html#57" class="refrence-link"><sup>[57]</sup></a> Secondly, MyPass makes it possible for service providers to know which services a person has used previously. An example of where this would be particularly helpful is healthcare. It is vital that service providers have an understanding of the past care that a patient has received, and with this data in hand it service providers can more easily determine how to build upon the care provided.<a href="references.html#58" class="refrence-link"><sup>[58]</sup></a> In addition, MyPass also improves upon how securely a homeless individual's data is held. Unlike systems such as the previously mentioned CES. Users of MyPass retain full ownership over their data and have the ability to remove any data they provide at any time.<a href="references.html#59" class="refrence-link"><sup>[59]</sup></a> In addition, any data that is stored can only be accessed with the consent of the user thanks to the decentralised nature of blockchain networks. What this means is that data held on the user is not stored in one central point.<a href="references.html#60" class="refrence-link"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Instead, it is fragmented into parts that are stored separately so to not rely on a "single point of failure." All of which makes it much more difficult to access without consent.<a href="references.html#61" class="refrence-link"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p>The issue of improper identity documentation halting homeless support services is not unique to the City of Austin. The UK could also benefit immensely from implementing a similar system. Many of the UK's support services and government benefit systems rely on identity documentation. Examples include universal credit<a href="references.html#62" class="refrence-link"><sup>[62]</sup></a>, centre point<a href="references.html#63" class="refrence-link"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and local council homeless assessments.<a href="references.html#64" class="refrence-link"><sup>[64]</sup></a> Through the implementation of a similar system to MyPass the UK could see improved access systems of support which could ultimately lead to reduced growth in homeless populations.</p>
