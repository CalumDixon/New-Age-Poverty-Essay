  <meta name="description" content="The evidence is clear. UK Homeless populations are rapidly growing and technology's role in this is negative and positive. it has both contributed to the issue and been used to develop solutions. Ultimately technology is neither force for evil or good, it's a tool which can be used for either. What matters most is that we take action. What must be done is continuing to find new methods of using technology to help those in need, alongside finding ways to mitigate the harm caused to homeless communities from technology. For instance, one method can be seen in the form of government policy against the previously mentioned Airbnb. Many major cities across the globe have introduced rules to limit the number of days a host can sublet their property. London for example has restricted subletting to 90 days. Which has helped remove the incentive for landlords to move their properties to Airbnb as it has become less profitable." />

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="para-after-title">The UK is facing a homelessness crisis. The current scale of homelessness in the UK is not completely clear as many that become homeless are never documented as such. The UK charity Shelter estimates that the nation's homeless population is 280,000.<a href="references.html#1" class="refrence-link"><sup>[1]</sup></a> However, numbers could be even higher as many people experiencing homelessness never reach out to local councils for help. Adding to this impact, homeless populations are rapidly rising in the UK. Shelter has reported that the number of households deemed to be homeless has increased by 23% between 2018 and 2019.<a href="references.html#2" class="refrence-link"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Unfortunately, these trends also show no sign of slowing down, with Crisis UK projecting that the UK homeless population will double to 570,000 by 2041.<a href="references.html#3" class="refrence-link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Additionally, Shelter has reported that the number of UK households at risk of homeless has increased by 11.4% in England.<a href="references.html#4" class="refrence-link"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The increases in the number of at-risk households is a result of rising income inequality across the country. As the Financial Times have reported the median income of the UK's poorest 20% of households has dropped by 4.3% over the past two years. In addition, the UK's GINI coefficient (A metric of 0-100% which can be used to measure income inequality, the higher the percentage the more unequal the society) rose from 33.4% to 34.7%.<a href="references.html#5" class="refrence-link"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p>This essay will explore what homelessness is and analyse the negative and positive effects that the information age has had on homeless populations in the UK. This will be achieved through the use of case studies, examples include, how Airbnb is driving up rent prices leading to homelessness and how the use of digital identities such as MyPass give homeless communities faster access to health and social care. These case studies will explain how technology has potentially contributed to the UK's rising homeless populations and how it has affected the lifestyles of those experiencing homelessness. However, before we can begin to analyse the impact of technology. We must first build a better understanding of what homelessness is. We can’t build a true understanding of technology’s impact on homelessness if we don’t have a basic foundational understanding of the problem.</p>
