  <meta name="description" content="This essay will explore what homelessness is and analyse the negative and positive effects that the information age has had on homeless populations in the UK. This will be achieved through the use of case studies, examples include, how Airbnb is driving up rent prices leading to homelessness and how the use of digital identities such as MyPass give homeless communities faster access to health and social care. These case studies will explain how technology has potentially contributed to the UK's rising homeless populations and how it has affected the lifestyles of those experiencing homelessness." />

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p class="para-after-title">The evidence is clear. UK Homeless populations are rapidly growing and technology's role in this is negative and positive. it has both contributed to the issue and been used to develop solutions. Ultimately technology is neither force for evil or good, it's a tool which can be used for either. What matters most is that we take action. What must be done is continuing to find new methods of using technology to help those in need, alongside finding ways to mitigate the harm caused to homeless communities from technology. For instance, one method can be seen in the form of government policy against the previously mentioned Airbnb. Many major cities across the globe have introduced rules to limit the number of days a host can sublet their property. London for example has restricted subletting to 90 days.<a href="references.html#65" class="refrence-link"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Which has helped remove the incentive for landlords to move their properties to Airbnb as it has become less profitable.</p>

<p>In addition, technology should never be considered a "fix-all" solution. Technology-based solutions aren't necessarily a replacement for existing homeless support systems. For instance, while technology can enable us to better allocate homes to those that need them most and increase overall efficiency, it does not solve the underlying issue of not having enough homes for everyone. To solve this we would need to invest more in the building of social housing or through policy reform such as the adoption of the internationally acclaimed "housing first model." The housing first model works by removing the idea of testing if individuals are 'housing ready' and instead prioritises getting those in need into homes as soon as possible. From this point, any additional required support such as providing support to those struggling with addiction can be focused on while those in need are living in a stable environment where efforts are much more likely to succeed. The model has proven successful in roughly 80% of people with high support needs.<a href="references.html#66" class="refrence-link"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Meaning that through its adoption the UK could avoid having those helped re-entering a life of homelessness and needing service provider resources again. However, just like the technological solutions, the housing first model canâ€™t be the only solution we provide, it should be working in conjunction with other technological solutions, government policy reform and further investment. The only real solution is to have many.</p>
